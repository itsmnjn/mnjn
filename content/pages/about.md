Hi, I'm Min Jun. I do go by Eric, but feel free to call me whichever.

I'm a third-year studying Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), planning to graduate in December 2021.

I'm quite passionate about a lot of things, but primarily engineering/building stuff (anything, really, but I lean towards software due to easy accessibility). My other interests lie in space (particularly exploration), consciousness, music (Mac Miller's posthumous album is simply grandâ€”rest in peace, Mac), and writing (fiction, poetry, and this blog!).

In software, I enjoy working with the whole stack, completely language agnostic, from web applications to embedded systems to artificial intelligence and data science.

My long-term aspiration is to have contributed as much as possible to humanity's spacefaring capabilities and also in understanding our consciousness.
