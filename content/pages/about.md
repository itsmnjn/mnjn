Hi, I'm Min Jun. I do go by Eric, but feel free to call me whichever.

I'm currently a second-year studying Computer Engineering at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu), planning to graduate in December 2021.

I am primarily interested in full-stack web development, a little bit of mobile, and am quite excited for the coming AR revolution ðŸ™‚
